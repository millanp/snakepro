A bare-bones, retro snake game with fast performance, optimized for the pro snake player

I created this game out of dissatisfaction with the other retro snake game options out there. Games like [Worm](http://www.snakegame.net/worm.htm) and [NeaveSnake](http://www.snakegame.net/neavesnake.htm) just don't cut it in terms of turning responsiveness, snake speed, and playfield size.
